## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop
- AWS CLI configured
- Git
- Make (for using Makefile)

### Development Setup
```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws_labmda_sslv_scrape_job.git
cd aws_labmda_sslv_scrape_job

# Set up upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/aws_labmda_sslv_scrape_job.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Follow the existing code style
- Add appropriate error handling
- Include logging for debugging
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Test locally
make build CITY=ogre
make test CITY=ogre

# Check logs
make logs CITY=ogre

# Clean up
make cleanup CITY=ogre
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add support for new city scraping"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings to all functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names

### Example Function
```python
def extract_data_from_url(urls: list) -> None:
    """
    Extract apartment data from SSLV message URLs.
    
    Args:
        urls: List of message URLs to process
        
    Returns:
        None: Data is written to local file
    """
    # Implementation here
```

### Error Handling
```python
try:
    # Main logic
    result = process_data(url)
except requests.RequestException as e:
    logger.error(f"Network error processing {url}: {e}")
    return None
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    raise
```

## Adding New Cities

### 1. Update app.py
Add new city URLs to the handler function:
```python
def handler(event, context):
    # Add new city pages
    page_one = requests.get("https://www.ss.lv/lv/real-estate/flats/new-city/sell/")
    page_two = requests.get("https://www.ss.lv/lv/real-estate/flats/new-city/sell/page2.html")
    page_three = requests.get("https://www.ss.lv/lv/real-estate/flats/new-city/sell/page3.html")
```

### 2. Update Documentation
- Add city to supported cities list
- Update examples in documentation
- Add city-specific configuration if needed

### 3. Test Thoroughly
```bash
# Test new city
make build CITY=newcity
make test CITY=newcity
```
